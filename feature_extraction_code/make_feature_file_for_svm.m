%Why it's important that features_mat is a row vector:
%If you run cell2mat on it, you get one really long row
%when what you actually want is each cell to be a row, with each element in
%each cell being a column. At least that's what I want here.
features_mat = cell2mat(features_mat'); % <--Hence the transpose

underscore_ids = strfind(cbin_fn,'_');

save_fname = [bird_name '_svm_ftr_file_from_' dstr '_generated_' datestr(now,'mm-dd-yy_HH-MM')];
